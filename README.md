# musicleagueexporter
JS function to export the playlist

This could be added to a browser plugin or something, but I didn't feel like going through the effort since MusicLeague could change up the layout at any time.  Who knows, maybe they'll see this on GitHub and say "maybe we could do this, it would be helpful" or "we could just autosave as people type notes"

How to use:
1) In a browsers, not the app (if you can do it in app why are you using my code?) go to your league and click on "Submit Your Votes" so you see the voting scren
2) Press F12 to open the developer window
3) Find the Console in the developer window
4) Past the code from musicleagecsv.js and hit enter
5) Download of playlist.csv should happen almost immediately
6) The table is printed to the console too and you should be able to copy it out if the csv is weird
